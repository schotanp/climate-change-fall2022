# Preparation
Follow the steps below to prepare MATLAB Online and your get your data pack for this assignment.

## 1. Activate MATLAB and open MATLAB Online
As a student at McMaster, you have access to MATLAB through McMaster's [web portal](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/mcmaster-university-31501097.html). From this portal, you can download the MATLAB installer to install it on your local desktop or laptop, or access and use MATLAB online--an completely online version of the software. For this assignment, we'll be using the online version. If you don't already have one, you'll be required to create a MathWorks account. 

- Navigate to https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html
- Click **Start using MATLAB Online**
- On the MATLAB Online login page, choose to **create an account**

## 2. Add the assignment data pack to MATLAB Drive & MATLAB Online
Before you can begin the assignment, the assignment pack materials need to be uploaded to your [MATLAB Drive](https://drive.matlab.com/files/). This will make these files usable in MATLAB Online. Two options for doing this have been outlined below--**you only need to do one**. 

### Option 1: Using a MATLAB Drive share
- Click on [this link](https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/3d411629-c97a-490e-b7bb-479b87616cdb) to view the shared assignment data pack in MATLAB Drive. 
- In the **Sharing Preview** page, select ```+ Add to my Files > Copy Folder```

- You should now see a folder called ```iSci3A12-CC-SciProgramming``` in your MATLAB Drive and in MATLAB Online. The folder should contain a number of files and subfolders.

### Option 2: Upload files to MATLAB Drive
- Click on [this link](https://github.com/iSci-3A12/scientific-programming/raw/main/assets/data/iSci3A12-CC-SciProgramming.zip) to download the assignment data pack from this assignment's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iSci-3A12/scientific-programming) to your local computer as a zip file. 
- On your local computer, extract the zip file to a folder named ```iSci3A12-CC-SciProgramming```.
- Go to your [MATLAB Drive](https://drive.matlab.com/files/) select ```Upload > Folder```
![MATLAB Drive folder upload page](assets/img/matlab-drive-upload-folder.png)
- Choose to upload your extracted ```iSci3A12-CC-SciProgramming``` folder to MATLAB Drive.
- You should now see a folder called ```iSci3A12-CC-SciProgramming``` in your MATLAB Drive and in MATLAB Online. The folder should contain a number of files and subfolders.

## 3. Continue to the first lesson
Now that you have MATLAB Online set up, continue to the [first lesson](a3-lesson1).
