# Lesson 2: Intermediate Operations

**Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes**  
In this lesson, you will build upon the [basics](lesson1) to create working scripts and functions and perform some analyses. By the end of this lesson, you will have created ***two*** of your required deliverables: 
- Your modified version of ```my_lucky_numbers.m```
- The figure ```my_lucky_numbers.png``` that you will create during your analyses

## 1. Setup
1. Make sure your **Working Directory** is set to ```/ > MATLAB Drive > iSci3A12-SciProgramming```. This is where we will run our scripts and analyses. 
1. In MATLAB, open the following files in the **Editor** window: 
  - The script ```iSci_Intermediate.m```, and 
  - The function ```iSci_lucky_numbers.m```

## 2. Edit and save a new function
1. Save a copy of ```iSci_lucky_numbers.m``` in the same direcotory and name it ```my_lucky_numbers.m```:
  - With ```iSci_lucky_numbers``` open, click ```Save > Save As...```  
![Save As Dialog Box](img/saveas.png)
  - Name the new file ```my_lucky_numbers.m```
1. In the *function declaration* (the top line) in ```my_lucky_numbers.m```, change the function name from ```iSci_lucky_numbers``` to ```my_lucky_numbers```. Save your changes. 
  - **NOTE**: When you call a function, it will execute the *last saved version* of the file. As a result, you need to save your changes to a function before it will be reflected in the output.

## 3. Completing the lesson 

### 3.1 Understand my_lucky_numbers
1. Read through the code and comments in ```my_lucky_numbers```. You don't need to understand every command, but try to get a sense of the logic behind the function. 
1. Using the usage example provided, run the function a few times to understand its output.
1. Edit your ```my_lucky_numbers``` function so that instead of returning numbers between 1 and 49, it returns numbers between 1 and 100. 
  - **HINT**: Find the value ```49``` in the code and replace it with ```100```.
  - Save your changes. 
  
### 3.2 The scenario
You’ve been given a "lucky number generating program" from a friend (called ```my_lucky_numbers```). You suspect that it’s outputting nothing but uniformly random numbers between 1 and 100. How can you investigate this?

### 3.3 The analysis

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> For this lesson, you will work through the exercises within the script <b>iSci_Intermediate.m</b>. The instructions are embedded as comments in the script, and you can run through the steps by highlighting line(s) and executing them in the Command Window with the F9 key (Windows) or Fn+Shift+F7 (Mac).</p>

## 4. Deliverables
- Ensure that your figure ```lucky_random_numbers.png``` has been created using all of the formatting commands included at the end of ```Intermeidate.m``` (you don't need to add anything else beyond what exists in the script), and looks similar to the image that Jay showed in the final video.  You'll download this from MATLAB Drive in order to submit. 
- Ensure that all changes to your function ```my_lucky_numbers.m``` is saved.

## 5. Head to the next exercise
Once you're done here, head to the [next lesson](a3-lesson3) to write your own function.
